# Hyprland-Config

My very first Hyprland rice. It's not really good or anything, I have just made a github config just so that I can easily access it whenever I change my laptop/desktop in the future and to test out the rice (in case something goes wrong, I can just clone this and fix the mistake rather than retyping everything from scratch).

You are welcome to use it, but I'm not really gonna maintain it or anything. I AM NOT PROFICIENT in hyprland or linux.

So whatever you do, do it at your own discretion.

But if you do choose to install this, just FYI, many of the things don't work (for now), so it'll be more problems for you to setup and execute.

Basic keybinds and all work, but you cannot choose wallpaper (yet). Or have a fully configured waybar config and style file.
