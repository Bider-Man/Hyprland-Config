# Hyprland-Config

My very first Hyprland rice. It's not really good or anything, I have just made a github config just so that I can easily access it whenever I change my laptop/desktop in the future.

You are welcome to use it, but I'm not really gonna maintain it or anything. I AM NOT PROFICIENT in hyprland or linux.

So whatever you do, do it at your own discretion.
