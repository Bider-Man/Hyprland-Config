# Hyprland-Config

##  I AM NOT PROFICIENT in Hyprland or Linux.

My very first Hyprland rice. It's not really good or anything, I have just made a github config just so that I can easily access it whenever I change my laptop/desktop in the future and to test out the rice (in case something goes wrong, I can just clone this and fix the mistake rather than retyping everything from scratch).

You are welcome to use it, but I'm not really gonna solve any bugs you might encounter or anything.

So whatever you do, do it at your own discretion.

But if you do choose to install this, any problem you run into you're gonna have to solve it yourself. I am not going to be able to help (most likely)

A few things don't work, like being able to switch wallpapers or being able to press a button and have the shutdown menu appear. I plan to add that, but slowly since I'm still learning.

I plan to make this a fully-configured setup. But since I'm new, it'll be slow progress.

I'm doing this in my free time, so as you can expect it'll be slow to update (major updates at least).

Any criticism is also welcome :D

# Installation Process

Just make sure to have hyprutils and yay already installed before running the script. Everything else should be installed without any problems.
