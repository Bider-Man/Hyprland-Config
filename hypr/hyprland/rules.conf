# Ensure no windows float by default
windowrule = [floating = off]

# Example: Allow Discord to float (remove or modify as needed)
#windowrule = [class = discord] [floating = on]

# Example: Allow dialogs or popups to float (this may depend on the specific app)
windowrule = [class = some-dialog] [floating = on]

# Example: Allow certain apps like media players to float
#windowrule = [class = spotify] [floating = on]
#windowrule = [class = vlc] [floating = on]

# Optionally, set specific behavior for other apps
# Example: Set Firefox to be always in a specific workspace, never floating
windowrule = [class = firefox] [workspace = 1] [floating = off]

# Set terminal windows to never float
windowrule = [class = kitty] [floating = off]
windowrule = [foot = alacritty] [floating = off]

# Set window behavior for file managers (like PCManFM)
windowrule = [class = thunar] [floating = off]

# Example: Override floating behavior for specific windows (e.g., dialogs, notifications)
# These can be used to float certain types of windows while keeping the rest tiled
windowrule = [class = notification] [floating = on]

# Optional: Adjust for certain apps to open on specific workspaces or positions
# Example: Set Steam to open on workspace 3
windowrule = [class = steam] [workspace = 3] [floating = off]
